/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Mantra
/*
Lucidity came slowly
I awoke from dreams of untying a great knot
It unraveled like a braid into what seemed were thousands of separate
Strands of fishing line
Attached to a coarse behavior it flowed
A calm it urged, what else is here?

How's it feel to be at the center of magic
To linger in tones and words?
I opened the floodgates and found no water, no current, no river, no rush
How's it feel to stand at the height of your powers
To captivate every heart?
Projecting your visions to strangers who feel it, who listen
Who linger on every word
Oh it's a rush!
Oh it's a rush!

But alone *it feels like dying!*
All alone *I feel so much!*

***I want my offering to woo, to calm, to clear, to solve!***
But the only offering that comes
It calls, it screams, ***there's nothing here!!***

How's it feel to be at the center of magic
To linger in tones and words?
I opened the floodgates and found no water, no current, no river, no rush
How's it feel to stand at the height of your powers
To captivate every heart?
Projecting your visions to strangers who feel it, who listen
Who linger on every word
Oh it's a rush
Oh it's a rush...

/* 365 Steps March!

(One-two, one-two! So, one-two, one-two!)
Verse 1:
Happiness doesn't walk to me
So I'll walk to it.
One day, one step,
Three steps in three days.
Three steps forward, two steps back,
Life's a one-two punch!
Chorus:
Let's walk, sweating and crying.
Beautiful flowers will surely bloom
On the footprints you leave behind.
Swing your arms, lift your legs,
One-two, one-two! Keep walking without resting!
(So, one-two, one-two! One-two, one-two!)
Verse 2:
The door to happiness is narrow,
So you have to stoop to pass through.
One hundred days, one hundred steps,
One thousand days, one thousand steps.
Some days things go well, some days they don't,
Life's a one-two punch!
Chorus:
Let's walk, sweating and crying.
Beautiful flowers will surely bloom
On the footprints you leave behind.
Swing your arms, lift your legs,
One-two, one-two! Keep walking without resting!
(So, one-two, one-two! One-two, one-two!)
Verse 3:
Even if happiness is right next to you,
There are days you won't realize it.
365 days a year,
Even if you miss it by one step,
Life's a one-two punch!
Chorus:
Let's walk, sweating and crying.
Beautiful flowers will surely bloom
On the footprints you leave behind.
Swing your arms, lift your legs,
One-two, one-two! Keep walking without resting!
(So, one-two, one-two! One-two, one-two!)

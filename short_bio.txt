/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Mantra
/*
Lucidity came slowly
I awoke from dreams of untying a great knot
It unraveled like a braid into what seemed were thousands of separate
Strands of fishing line
Attached to a coarse behavior it flowed
A calm it urged, what else is here?

How's it feel to be at the center of magic
To linger in tones and words?
I opened the floodgates and found no water, no current, no river, no rush
How's it feel to stand at the height of your powers
To captivate every heart?
Projecting your visions to strangers who feel it, who listen
Who linger on every word
Oh it's a rush!
Oh it's a rush!

But alone *it feels like dying!*
All alone *I feel so much!*

***I want my offering to woo, to calm, to clear, to solve!***
But the only offering that comes
It calls, it screams, ***there's nothing here!!***

How's it feel to be at the center of magic
To linger in tones and words?
I opened the floodgates and found no water, no current, no river, no rush
How's it feel to stand at the height of your powers
To captivate every heart?
Projecting your visions to strangers who feel it, who listen
Who linger on every word
Oh it's a rush
Oh it's a rush...

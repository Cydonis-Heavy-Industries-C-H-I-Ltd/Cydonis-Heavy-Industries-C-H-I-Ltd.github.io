Climate Crisis = Great Fermi Filter.

Other Fermi filter events:

* Solar Expansion due to sun's exhaustion of available hydrogen and then helium as it begins to fuse heavier and heavier elements, and eventually and gradually expanding.
* Pandemic(s). Fungal, Bacterial, and as with COVID-19, viral threats to life and personal and population health.
* Resource Constraints: Humanity is ulitamtely resource constrained (as to population size) due to the laws of thermodynamics, both on Earth and in the overall solar system, and beyond.
* AI/Automation Revolution: Weaponisation of drone(s) technology when combined with the climate crisis and global population movements to more favourable enviromental/socio-economic condition(s).
